# Sample configuration file for retrogame.
# Really minimal syntax, typically two elements per line w/space delimiter:
# 1) a key name (from keyTable.h; shortened from /usr/include/linux/input.h).
# 2) a GPIO pin number; when grounded, will simulate corresponding keypress.
# Uses Broadcom pin numbers for GPIO.
# If first element is GND, the corresponding pin (or pins, multiple can be
# given) is a LOW-level output; an extra ground pin for connecting buttons.
# A '#' character indicates a comment to end-of-line.
# File can be edited "live," no need to restart retrogame!

# Here's a pin configuration for the PiGRRL 2 project:

LEFT      21  # Joypad left
RIGHT     20  # Joypad right
UP         1  # Joypad up
DOWN      12  # Joypad down
LEFTCTRL  19  # 'A' button
LEFTALT    5  # 'B' button
Z          6  # 'X' button
X         13  # 'Y' button
SPACE     26  # 'Select' button
ENTER     16  # 'Start' button
#A        12  # Left shoulder button
#S        13  # Right shoulder button
#ESC      17  # Exit ROM; PiTFT Button 1
#1        22  # PiTFT Button 2
#2        23  # PiTFT Button 3
#3        27  # PiTFT Button 4

# For configurations with few buttons (e.g. Cupcade), a key can be followed
# by multiple pin numbers.  When those pins are all held for a few seconds,
# this will generate the corresponding keypress (e.g. ESC to exit ROM).
# Only ONE such combo is supported within the file though; later entries
# will override earlier.
